# Ocean-Filter
Example project following tutorial on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/project/interactive-face-filter)

- this project is made with Unity 2022, the universal render pipeline & the XR package with face tracking in AR Kit
- particle effects using meshes (of fish) are being added using the [visual effects graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@14.0/manual/index.html) package as an additional learning exercise  
- some assets came from the asset store & Unity
- some assets were hacked out using Sketch to create an SVG file & then imported into Blender 3D to be extruded into 3D
- the project makes use of prefab game objects
- a basic UI was created using [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/UIElements.html) with UXML as an additional learning exercise
